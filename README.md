MODEL-BASED SYSTEMS ENGINEERING ARCHITECTURE FRAMEWORK 
Based on Archimate 3.1 (TOGAF) modeling language and Archi tool

This model represents some processes, methods and tools used by AH. 
It was built in collaboration between ET and EI in order to formalize some design office processes from myCES as well as some specific m√©tiers processes and to establish the relationships between them and the IT world. In particular, the model defines:
- business objects, processes, roles and organizations (Business layer)
- application data, components and flows (Application layer)
- infrastructure components and structure (Infrastructure Layer)

The scope covers the full DEVELOP domain, former DEV-01, DEV-02 and DEV-04 with some connections with DEV-08 and DEV-09.

The 3 layers Business-Application-Infrastructure are linked and maintained in consistency.
In addition, the different layers are based on analysis, review and update of data coming from other AH referentials to keep the information consistent from an enterprise architecture point of view:

- the Business layer is consistent with myCES: new DEV-01 and DEV-02 are currently reviewed to converge on a *DEV-01 process more relevant and close to actual H/C systems engineering processes

- the Application layer is consistent with Alfabet (Application Portfolio Management), i.e. all business applications and related information defined in Alfabet are consistent with the Archimate model

- the Infrastructure layer is consistent with ServiceNow information on servers and environments

For a global overview, the INDEX in the model tree VIEW is the entry point to the 3 layers.
The "OVERALL DEVELOP DOMAIN - Business layer" gives you a global picture of the new DEVELOP business processes.
